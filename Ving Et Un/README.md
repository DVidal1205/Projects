# Ving Et Un Dice Game

## Description

This program is a simplistic spin-off of the card game Blackjack but with 6-sided dice instead, using a series of logic statements and decision-structures. I programmed this game as a final project in my Intro to Programming course. If you want to run this code in the web, visit my Replit repository (https://replit.com/@DVidal1205/Ving-Et-Un#main.py).
