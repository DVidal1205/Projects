# Ving Et Un Dice Game

## Description

This program is a simplistic copy of a Cactpot lottery game using parallel two-dimensional array processing and switch-decision structures. I programmed this project as a final project in my Intro to C++ course. If you want to run this code in the web, visit my Replit repository (https://replit.com/@DVidal1205/Cactpot-Lottery-Game#CactPot.cpp)
