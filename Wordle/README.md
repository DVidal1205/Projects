# New York Times - Wordle

## Description

This program is a replica of New York Times' popular game Wordle, utilizing classes, two dimensional arrays, dynamic memory allocation, random file access functions, and other various topics I learned in my semester of intermediate C++ programming. This was a collaborative final project that scoed my team and I a 100%.
